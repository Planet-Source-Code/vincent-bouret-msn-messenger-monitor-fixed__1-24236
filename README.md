### Description

This program is a simple monitor for MSN Messenger Service. You just have to boot this, and then log normally with MSN Messenger. The app will act as a monitor to show you how the client is communicating with Microsoft servers. I actually did a complete MSN Messenger Client from scratch and compatible with existing protocol and I will soon post it here. With this monitor, you should have a great idea of the great communication procotol. For the complete MSN Messenger Protocol goto: http://www.tlsecurity.net/Textware/Misc/draft-movva-msn-messenger-protocol-00.txt Don't forget to change your registry settings: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MessengerService\' find the key "Server" and change it to 127.0.0.1;127.0.0.1:1863 and don't forget to backup your original values. If you already erased it, the initial value that should work is messenger.hotmail.com;127.0.0.1:1863
